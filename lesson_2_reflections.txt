What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It will save all the future changes of this repository without havind to create multiple copies in case i need backups

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is a working directory without the commits, git add ; adds the files ready to commit. It gives you the option to choose the files that you are going to track through the changes

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
you get to choose to add only the files you would want to the changes to commit instead of all the changes you make in all the files. Commits will be smaller too.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
They are helpful for adding experimental features, creating  different versions of the same product, maybe different languages etc.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
they are helpful and easier for me to understand the commits flow and which commits are being applied to which branches; also the current master branch

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
it compares the additions and deletions and forms a new master commit. The diagram is easier to understand to see which commits were left out

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Automatic merging saves time but you wouldn't what changes were made in the process. Manual merging will give you a headsup about the changes being made and the authors will get to choose between keeping them or discarding them; cons - have to check the changes manually and also takes time.
