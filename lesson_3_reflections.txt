Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    clones are just copies and it copies to your local file. branches are adding new features or fixing bugs without affecting your master branch, you create new branch
    forks saved with your github and they get saved with them

and what would be harder?

    using it in local will give you privacy, but github will have access to any system and collaboration

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    sperate branch will allow you to experiment without the fear of losing changes to the original master branch

the freedom to push gives you the flexibilty just when you want to commit changes to github
